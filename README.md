# Footstep Power Generation System

## 📖 Description
The Footstep Power Generation System converts mechanical energy from human footsteps into electrical energy using piezoelectric sensors. The generated voltage is monitored using an Arduino, which counts the number of steps and displays real-time voltage output on a 16×2 I2C LCD. An LED provides visual indication for each detected step, demonstrating a sustainable energy harvesting concept.
